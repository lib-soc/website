    "p1": "We establish worker cooperatives, which is a business model where employees own and control the enterprise. Each worker has a voice in decision-making, and profits are distributed based on individual contributions. This participatory structure fosters ownership, motivation, and job satisfaction, creating a more fulfilling work experience as well as challenging the wealth concentration in traditional capitalist businesses.",
    "p2": "By focusing on employees' needs, our cooperatives create supportive and sustainable work environments that foster social cohesion and job security. We also prioritize the interests of local communities, taking a long-term perspective. With workers making decisions, we avoid harmful short-term profit-driven strategies and instead reinvest our profits, contributing to community development and resilience.",
