We engage in mutual aid and collective action to address immediate challenges within capitalism. Through mutual aid, we support each other by sharing resources, knowledge, and skills, fostering solidarity and resilience. Whether it's community gardens, food cooperatives, or support networks, our goal is to make life under capitalism more bearable and create pockets of resistance and alternatives within the system.",
