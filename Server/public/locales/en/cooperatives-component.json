    "p1": "We establish worker cooperatives, which is a business model where employees own and control the enterprise. Each worker has a voice in decision-making, and profits are distributed based on individual contributions. This participatory structure fosters ownership, motivation, and job satisfaction, creating a more fulfilling work experience as well as challenging the wealth concentration in traditional capitalist businesses. By focusing on employees' needs, our cooperatives create supportive and sustainable work environments that foster social cohesion and job security. We also prioritize the interests of local communities, taking a long-term perspective.",
